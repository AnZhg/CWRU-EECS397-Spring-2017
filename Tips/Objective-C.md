Objective-C is a object oriented programming language. It is a strict superset of C language, which means you can use any C language features, and mix Objective-C and C however you want.

Objective-C code has the extension of ".m".

To compile an Objective-C source code, there are some packages required.

1. gcc

This comes with Raspbian.

2. gobjc

    sudo apt-get install gobjc

3. GNUStep development library

    sudo apt-get install gnustep-devel
